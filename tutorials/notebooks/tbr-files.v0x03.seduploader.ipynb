We then use the [struct] unit to parse the integers from the opcode sequence; the struct format `{n:B}{a:L}` contains two format fields: `{n:B}` to read the one-byte string length value into the variable `n`, and `{a:L}` to read the 4-byte string address value into the variable `a`.

    "It is already quite clear that some of these are probably false positives; for example, the \"address\" `0x00008088` is invalid. That should not be a problem for our next step, though. We now want to adjust the pipeline so that we actually extract the encrypted strings rather than just their addresses. At the end of our current pipeline, we are working on a stream of 5-byte sequences which encode a length (as one byte) and an address: We have already lost the data of the original sample when we ran the [rex] command. To correct this, we will first use [put] to store a backup of the sample data in a variable called `bin`. This variable will still be attached to the results of [rex] when they pass to the [struct] unit. We then alter the [struct] command as follows:\n",

In this case, we are instructing it to output the contents of the previously defined variable `bin`. After this command, the output will be several copies of the malware sample, each of which has meta variables `a` and `n` defined, specifying the virtual address and length of what is potentially an encrypted string. To extract the actual strings, we use the [vsnip] unit, which can extract data from executable formats based on virtual addresses. We specify the `--quiet` flag for [vsnip] because we already know that some addresses will be bogus and we want to simply ignore those warnings.\n",

Hence, after the [push] instruction, the frame contains a visible copy of the sample data, and one invisible copy. Invisible chunks are passed on along the frame, but refinery units to not operate on them. Hence, the first [vsnip] command is only executed on the visible chunk, extracting the 13 key bytes from their known address. The invocation of [pop] does two things: It takes the first visible chunk in the current frame and associates it with the variable `key`. Then, it makes all remaining chunks visible again and attaches the variable `key` to them. In this case, we end up with a copy of the original sample, with a variable named `key`, containing the decryption key. Everything after that is identical to the previous pipeline, with the exception that we can now pass the variable `key` to the [xor] unit rather than the hardcoded value.\n",

    "This combines the techniques from the previous two sections. Here is a quick overview of how the pipeline works. The first regular expression looks for the following opcode sequence from the string decryption function, where `X` is the stack offset of the chunk size variable, `Y` is the chunk size value, and `Z` is the address of the key string:\n",

    "We use [push]/[pop] as in the previous pipeline, except that we did not hard-code the offset of the key buffer, but instead searched for a characteristic opcode sequence to determine the address. The second regular expression looks for the following opcode sequence from the code that decrypts the C2 servers:\n",

    "The value `X` is the address of the list and `Y` contains the size of each chunk. The former is then stored in the variable `a`, the latter in the variable `n`. After having determined these values, we can again proceed as in the previous pipeline with a few modifications: We [vsnip] _all_ memory starting at `a`, then [chop] it into chunks of size `n` and decrypt them. Now, we have likely extracted and decrypted quite a few chunks that are not actually C2 domains. To filter them out, we use the [iffp] unit: It takes as its parameter the name of any pattern known to [carve] and [xtp] and removes any chunk from the frame that does not match this pattern. In this case, we will only forward chunks that look like a domain. And that's it - a somewhat automatic SedUpLoader config extractor in refinery!\n",
