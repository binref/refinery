We then open a [frame] so that we can work on each of these strings individually. Each string is then decrypted by subtracting the bytes of a key using the [sub] unit; this key is generated from the following [multibin] expression:\n",

There are a number of patterns available by name, in this case we are interested in domains. Run `xtp -h` to obtain a list of all currently available indicator patterns. Finally, we use [defang] because these domains will end up in a Jupiter notebook and we want to prevent that some web component somewhere becomes overeager and turns them into a clickable link. Because we would like to have the outputs separated by new lines in the terminal, we finally pipe the results to [sep] before closing the frame.\n",

There is reason to believe that the other two sequences are used as decryption keys for other kinds of data, but that's something you can figure out later. For now, we would like to devise a refinery pipeline that has a chance to work on other samples where the string encryption key might be different. We will, however, assume that the format of the key will always be lowercase hex and 32 characters in length. This is clearly not a safe assumption, but I'll need you to get all the way off of my back about that so that the tutorial can happen. First, let's get all the potential keys out of our sample:"

    "First, we use [rex] (the regular expression unit) to search for all 32-letter lowercase hex strings. For each of those, we invoke the [pf] unit so that I can talk about it in this tutorial. Its command line arguments are interpreted as a Python format string expression which can use any [meta] variables and the symbol `{}`, the latter representing the body of the current chunk. In this case, we use the magic [meta] variable `index` which represents the index of the current chunk in the frame. Since the chunk index is `0`-based, we have to add `1` in order to have the output list start at `1`. Finally, notice that we did not use the [sep] unit, but the output was separated by newlines anyway: This happened because we used `]]` rather than `]` to close the frame; using more closing brackets than necessary will insert newlines between all output chunks. This is an intentional piece of syntactic sugar which has been added for convenience.\n",
