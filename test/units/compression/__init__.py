    "Three times Randolph Carter dreamed of the marvellous city, and three times was he snatched "
    "away while still he paused on the high terrace above it. All golden and lovely it blazed in "
    "the sunset, with walls, temples, colonnades, and arched bridges of veined marble, "
    "silver-basined fountains of prismatic spray in broad squares and perfumed gardens, and wide "
    "streets marching between delicate trees and blossom-laden urns and ivory statues in gleaming "
    "rows; while on steep northward slopes climbed tiers of red roofs and old peaked gables "
    "harbouring little lanes of grassy cobbles. It was a fever of the gods; a fanfare of supernal "
    "trumpets and a clash ofimmortal cymbals. Mystery hung about it as clouds about a fabulous "
    "unvisited mountain; and as Carter stood breathless and expectant on that balustraded parapet "
    "there swept up to him the poignancy and suspense of almost-vanished memory, the pain of lost "
    "things, and the maddening need to place again what once had an awesome and momentous place.\0"

    'He knew that for him its meaning must once have been supreme; though in what cycle or '
    'incarnation he had known it, or whether in dream or in waking, he could not tell. Vaguely it '
    'called up glimpses of a far, forgotten first youth, when wonder and pleasure lay in all the '
    'mystery of days, and dawn and dusk alike strode forth prophetick to the eager sound of lutes '
    'and song; unclosing faery gates toward further and surprising marvels. But each night as he '
    'stood on that high marble terrace with the curious urns and carven rail and looked off over '
    'that hushed sunset city of beauty and unearthly immanence, he felt the bondage of dream\'s '
    'tyrannous gods; for in no wise could he leave that lofty spot, or descend the wide marmoreal '
    'flights flung endlessly down to where those streets of elder witchery lay outspread and '
    'beckoning.\0'
